User guide: Basically, the remote controller is everything that the users need to be able to interact
with the system. To start the game, just press the power button. Press the func/stop button to
return to the start screen and press the power button again to do a soft reset. VOL+, VOL-,
forward, and backward buttons are for navigating the cells. The pause button is for removing the
previous answer in the current cell. The number buttons are all acceptable values that can be
entered into the cell. The scores are distributed as shown below:
Highest: 
9 <= 5min
7 > 5min & <= 10min
5 > 10min & <= 15min
3 >15 min & <= 20min
